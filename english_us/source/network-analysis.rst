Network analysis library
========================

Starting from `ee19294562 <https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/ee19294562b00c6ce957945f14c1727210cffdf7>`_
(QGIS >= 1.8) the new network analysis library was added to the QGIS core
analysis library. The library:

 * creates mathematical graph from geographical data (polyline vector layers)
 * implements basics method of the graph theory (currently only Dijkstra's
   algorithm)

Network analysis library was created by exporting basics functions from
RoadGraph core plugin and now you can use it's methods in plugins or
directly from Python console.

General information
-------------------

Briefly typical use case can be described as:

1. create graph from geodata (usually polyline vector layer)
2. run graph analysis
3. use analysis results (for example, visualize them)

Building graph
--------------

The first thing you need to do --- is to prepare input data, that is to
convert vector layer into graph. All further actions will use this graph,
not the layer.

As a source we can use any polyline vector layer. Nodes of the polylines
become graph vertices, and segments of the polylines are graph edges.
If several nodes have the same coordinates then they are the same graph vertex.
So two lines that have a common node become connected to each other.

Additionally, during graph creation it is possible to "fix" ("tie") to the
input vector layer any number of additional points. For each additional
point a match will be found --- closest graph vertex or closest graph edge.
In the latter case the edge will be splitted and new vertex added.

As the properties of the edge a vector layer attributes can be used and
length of the edge.

Converter from vector layer to graph is developed using `Builder <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern>`_
programming pattern. For graph construction response so-called Director.
There is only one Director for now: `QgsLineVectorLayerDirector <http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsLineVectorLayerDirector.html>`_.
The director sets the basic settings that will be used to construct a graph
from a line vector layer, used by the builder to create graph. Currently, as
in the case with the director, only one builder exists: `QgsGraphBuilder <http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsGraphBuilder.html>`_,
that creates `QgsGraph <http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsGraph.html>`_ objects.
You may want to implement your own builders that will build a graphs compatible
with such libraries as `BGL <http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html>`_
or `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_.

To calculate edge properties programming pattern `strategy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern>`_
is used. For now only `QgsDistanceArcProperter <http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsDistanceArcProperter.html>`_
strategy is available, that takes into account the length of the route. You
can implement your own strategy that will use all necessary parameters.
For example, RoadGraph plugin uses strategy that compute travel time
using edge length and speed value from attributes.

It's time to dive in the process.

First of all, to use this library we should import networkanalysis module::

from qgis.networkanalysis import *

Than create director::

# don't use information about road direction from layer attributes,
# all roads are treated as two-way
director = QgsLineVectorLayerDirector( vLayer, -1, '', '', '', 3 )

# use fied with index 5 as source of information about roads direction.
# unilateral roads with direct direction have attribute value "yes",
# unilateral roads with reverse direction — "1", and accordingly bilateral
# roads — "no". By default roads are treated as two-way. This
# scheme can be used with OpenStreetMap data
director = QgsLineVectorLayerDirector( vLayer, 5, 'yes', '1', 'no', 3 )

To construct a director  we should pass vector layer, that will be used
as source for graph and information about allowed movement on each road
segment (unilateral or bilateral movement, direct or reverse direction).
Here is full list of this parameters:

 * vl — vector layer used to build graph
 * directionFieldId — index of the attribute table field, where information
   about roads directions is stored. If -1, then don't use this info at all
 * directDirectionValue — field value for roads with direct direction
   (moving from first line point to last one)
 * reverseDirectionValue — field value for roads with reverse direction
   (moving from last line point to first one)
 * bothDirectionValue — field value for bilateral roads
   (for such roads we can move from first point to last and from last to first)
 * defaultDirection — default road direction. This value will be used for
   those roads where field directionFieldId is not set or have some value
   different from above.

It is necessary then to create strategy for calculating edge properties::

  properter = QgsDistanceArcProperter()

And tell the director about this strategy::

  director.addProperter( properter )

Now we can create builder, which will create graph. QgsGraphBuilder constructor
takes several arguments:

* crs — coordinate reference system to use. Mandatory argument.
* otfEnabled — use  «on the fly» reprojection or no. By default true (use OTF).
* topologyTolerance — topological tolerance. Default value is 0.
* ellipsoidID — ellipsoid to use. By default "WGS84".

::

  # only CRS is set, all other values are defaults
  builder = QgsGraphBuilder( myCRS )

Also  we can set several points, which will be used in analysis. For example::

  startPoint = QgsPoint( 82.7112, 55.1672 )
  endPoint = QgsPoint( 83.1879, 54.7079 )

Now all is in place so we can build graph and "tie" points to it::

  tiedPoints = director.makeGraph( builder, [ startPoint, endPoint ] )

Building graph can take some time (depends on number of features in a layer and
layer size). tiedPoints is a list with coordinates of "tied" points. When
build operation is finished we can get graph and use it for the analysis::

  graph = builder.graph()

With the next code we can get indexes of our points::

  startId = graph.findVertex( tiedPoints[ 0 ] )
  endId = graph.findVertex( tiedPoints[ 1 ] )


Graph analysis
--------------

Networks analysis is used to find answers on two questions: which vertices
are connected and how to find a shortest path. To solve this problems network
analysis library provides Dijkstra's algorithm.

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the best route from one of the vertices of the
graph to all the others and the values of the optimization parameters.
The results can be represented as shortest path tree.

The shortest path tree is as oriented weighted graph (or more precisely --- tree)
with the following properties:

  * only one vertex have no incoming edges — the root of the tree
  * all other vertices have only one incoming edge
  * if vertex B is reachable from vertex A, then path from A to B is single
    available path and it is optimal (shortest) on this graph

To get shortest path tree use methods Use methods :func:`shortestTree` and
:func:`dijkstra` of `QgsGraphAnalyzer <http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsGraphAnalyzer.html>`_
class. It is recommended to use method :func:`dijkstra` because it works
faster and uses memory more efficiently.

The :func:`shortestTree` method is useful when you want to walk around the
shortest path tree. It always creates new graph object (QgsGraph) and accepts
three variables:

  * source — input graph
  * startVertexIdx — index of the point on the tree (the root of the tree)
  * criterionNum — number of edge property to use (started from 0).

::

  tree = QgsGraphAnalyzer.shortestTree( graph, startId, 0 )

The :func:`dijkstra` method has the same arguments, but returns two arrays.
In the first array element i contains index of the incoming edge or -1 if there
are no incoming edges. In the second array element i contains distance from
the root of the tree to vertex i or DOUBLE_MAX if vertex i is unreachable
from the root.

::

  (tree, cost) = QgsGraphAnalyzer.dijkstra( graph, startId, 0 )

Here is very simple code to display shortest path tree using graph created
with :func:`shortestTree` method (select linestring layer in TOC and replace
coordinates with yours one). **Warning**: use this code only as an example,
it creates a lots of `QgsRubberBand <http://doc.qgis.org/api/classQgsRubberBand.html>`_
objects and may be slow on large datasets.

  from qgis.gui import *
  from qgis.networkanalysis import *

  vl = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
  director = QgsLineVectorLayerDirector( vl, -1, '', '', '', 3 )
  properter = QgsDistanceArcProperter()
  director.addProperter( properter )
  crs = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()
  builder = QgsGraphBuilder( crs )

  pStart = QgsPoint( -0.743804, 0.22954 )
  tiedPoint = director.makeGraph( builder, [ pStart ] )
  pStart = tiedPoint[ 0 ]

  graph = builder.graph()

  idStart = graph.findVertex( pStart )

  tree = QgsGraphAnalyzer.shortestTree( graph, idStart, 0 )

  i = 0;
  while ( i < tree.arcCount() ):
    rb = QgsRubberBand( qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas() )
    rb.setColor ( Qt.red )
    rb.addPoint ( tree.vertex( tree.arc( i ).inVertex() ).point() )
    rb.addPoint ( tree.vertex( tree.arc( i ).outVertex() ).point() )
    i = i + 1

Same thing but using :func:`dijkstra` method::

  from PyQt4.QtCore import *
  from PyQt4.QtGui import *

  from qgis.core import *
  from qgis.gui import *
  from qgis.networkanalysis import *

  vl = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()

  director.addProperter( properter )
  crs = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()
  builder = QgsGraphBuilder( crs )

  pStart = QgsPoint( -1.37144, 0.543836 )
  tiedPoint = director.makeGraph( builder, [ pStart ] )
  pStart = tiedPoint[ 0 ]

  graph = builder.graph()

  idStart = graph.findVertex( pStart )

  ( tree, costs ) = QgsGraphAnalyzer.dijkstra( graph, idStart, 0 )

  for edgeId in tree:
    if edgeId == -1:
      continue
    rb = QgsRubberBand( qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas() )
    rb.setColor ( Qt.red )
    rb.addPoint ( graph.vertex( graph.arc( edgeId ).inVertex() ).point() )
    rb.addPoint ( graph.vertex( graph.arc( edgeId ).outVertex() ).point() )

Finding shortest path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To find optimal path between two points the following approach is used. Both points
(start A and end B) are "tied" to graph when it builds. Than using methods
:func:`shortestTree` or :func:`dijkstra` we build shortest tree with root
in the start point A. In the same tree we also found end point B and start to
walk through tree from point B to point A. Whole algorithm can be written
as::

    assign Т = B
    while Т != A
        add point Т to path
        get incoming edge for point Т
        look for point ТТ, that is start point of this edge
        assign Т = ТТ
    add point А to path

At this point we have path, in the form of the inverted list of vertices
(vertices are listed in reversed order from end point to start one) that will
be visited during traveling by this path.

Here is the sample code for QGIS Python Console (you will need to select linestring
layer in TOC and replace coordinates in the code with yours) that uses method
:func:`shortestTree`::

  from PyQt4.QtCore import *
  from PyQt4.QtGui import *

  from qgis.core import *
  from qgis.gui import *
  from qgis.networkanalysis import *

  vl = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
  director = QgsLineVectorLayerDirector( vl, -1, '', '', '', 3 )
  properter = QgsDistanceArcProperter()
  director.addProperter( properter )
  crs = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()
  builder = QgsGraphBuilder( crs )

  pStart = QgsPoint( -0.835953, 0.15679 )
  pStop = QgsPoint( -1.1027, 0.699986 )

  tiedPoints = director.makeGraph( builder, [ pStart, pStop ] )
  graph = builder.graph()

  tStart = tiedPoints[ 0 ]
  tStop = tiedPoints[ 1 ]

  idStart = graph.findVertex( tStart )
  tree = QgsGraphAnalyzer.shortestTree( graph, idStart, 0 )

  idStart = tree.findVertex( tStart )
  idStop = tree.findVertex( tStop )

  if idStop == -1:
    print "Path not found"
  else:
    p = []
    while ( idStart != idStop ):
      l = tree.vertex( idStop ).inArc()
      if len( l ) == 0:
        break
      e = tree.arc( l[ 0 ] )
      p.insert( 0, tree.vertex( e.inVertex() ).point() )
      idStop = e.outVertex()

    p.insert( 0, tStart )
    rb = QgsRubberBand( qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas() )
    rb.setColor( Qt.red )

    for pnt in p:
      rb.addPoint(pnt)

And here is the same sample but using :func:`dikstra` method::

  from PyQt4.QtCore import *
  from PyQt4.QtGui import *

  from qgis.core import *
  from qgis.gui import *
  from qgis.networkanalysis import *

  vl = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
  director = QgsLineVectorLayerDirector( vl, -1, '', '', '', 3 )
  properter = QgsDistanceArcProperter()
  director.addProperter( properter )
  crs = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()
  builder = QgsGraphBuilder( crs )

  pStart = QgsPoint( -0.835953, 0.15679 )
  pStop = QgsPoint( -1.1027, 0.699986 )

  tiedPoints = director.makeGraph( builder, [ pStart, pStop ] )
  graph = builder.graph()

  tStart = tiedPoints[ 0 ]
  tStop = tiedPoints[ 1 ]

  idStart = graph.findVertex( tStart )
  idStop = graph.findVertex( tStop )

  ( tree, cost ) = QgsGraphAnalyzer.dijkstra( graph, idStart, 0 )

  if tree[ idStop ] == -1:
    print "Path not found"
  else:
    p = []
    curPos = idStop
    while curPos != idStart:
      p.append( graph.vertex( graph.arc( tree[ curPos ] ).inVertex() ).point() )
      curPos = graph.arc( tree[ curPos ] ).outVertex();

    p.append( tStart )

    rb = QgsRubberBand( qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas() )
    rb.setColor( Qt.red )

    for pnt in p:
      rb.addPoint(pnt)

Areas of the availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Area of availability for vertex A is a subset of graph vertices, that are
accessible from vertex A and cost of the path from A to this vertices are
not greater that some value.

More clearly this can be shown with the following example: "There is a fire station.
What part of city fire command can reach in 5 minutes? 10 minutes? 15 minutes?".
Answers on this questions are fire station's areas of availability.

To find areas of availablity we can use method :func:`dijksta` of the
:class:`QgsGraphAnalyzer` class. It is enough to compare elements of cost
array with predefined value. If cost[ i ] is less or equal than predefined
value, than vertex i is inside area of availability, otherwise --- outside.

More difficult it is to get borders of area of availablity. Bottom border --- is
a set of vertices that are still accessible, and top border --- is a set of
vertices which are not accesible. In fact this is simple: availability
border passed on such edges of the shortest path tree for which start vertex
is accessible and end vertex is not accessible.

Here is an example::

  from PyQt4.QtCore import *
  from PyQt4.QtGui import *

  from qgis.core import *
  from qgis.gui import *
  from qgis.networkanalysis import *

  vl = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
  director = QgsLineVectorLayerDirector( vl, -1, '', '', '', 3 )
  properter = QgsDistanceArcProperter()
  director.addProperter( properter )
  crs = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()
  builder = QgsGraphBuilder( crs )

  pStart = QgsPoint( 65.5462, 57.1509 )
  delta = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().getCoordinateTransform().mapUnitsPerPixel() * 1

  rb = QgsRubberBand( qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas(), True )
  rb.setColor( Qt.green )
  rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( pStart.x() - delta, pStart.y() - delta ) )
  rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( pStart.x() + delta, pStart.y() - delta ) )
  rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( pStart.x() + delta, pStart.y() + delta ) )
  rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( pStart.x() - delta, pStart.y() + delta ) )

  tiedPoints = director.makeGraph( builder, [ pStart ] )
  graph = builder.graph()
  tStart = tiedPoints[ 0 ]

  idStart = graph.findVertex( tStart )

  ( tree, cost ) = QgsGraphAnalyzer.dijkstra( graph, idStart, 0 )

  upperBound = []
  r = 2000.0
  i = 0
  while i < len(cost):
    if cost[ i ] > r and tree[ i ] != -1:
      outVertexId = graph.arc( tree [ i ] ).outVertex()
      if cost[ outVertexId ] < r:
        upperBound.append( i )
    i = i + 1

  for i in upperBound:
    centerPoint = graph.vertex( i ).point()
    rb = QgsRubberBand( qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas(), True )
    rb.setColor( Qt.red )
    rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( centerPoint.x() - delta, centerPoint.y() - delta ) )
    rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( centerPoint.x() + delta, centerPoint.y() - delta ) )
    rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( centerPoint.x() + delta, centerPoint.y() + delta ) )
    rb.addPoint( QgsPoint( centerPoint.x() - delta, centerPoint.y() + delta ) )
